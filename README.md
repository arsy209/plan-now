# Plan-Now

Planning different types of events and inviting your friends and family members has become much easier then before. With this site, a user can register/login where they can create a new event with a given day, start & end time, a small description of the event. Once that is created, the host can then invite other users that are registered on the site to the event. If you want specific people to come, the event can be created as an private event where only users invited by the host can rsvp. All users can also comment about the upcoming event.
